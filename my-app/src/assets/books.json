            "Review": ["The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, as you can probably tell by the title, is a really fun book, with some classic British humour and some wacky characters. After the success of this first book the series was developed, with some in the series much better than others. While it can be difficult with older books still being funny, the humour in this is timeless. Douglas Adams is similar to American sci-fi writer Kurt Vonnegut in his bizarre sci-fi ideas coupled with the pointless and clueless existence of mankind. We as the reader encounter the extraordinary aliens and robots in this story through the very relatable eyes of unassuming British protagonist Arthur Dent. This book was born from an orginal BBC radio show written by Adams, which was then further rewritten as a movie starring Martin Freeman. Among the notable characters of the story are: Genius dolphins who've played mankind for fish, a depressed robot (voiced in the film by Alan Rickman), repulsive alien race Vogons who have a misplaced passion for poetry and a machine which knows the answers to the universe (42). The book is well worth a read, though might feel a little dated in parts with the amount of cultural references sprinkled throughout."],

Made relevant again today with the blockbusters released recently by Denis Villeneuve (who also directed the fantastic science fiction film Arrival) Dune isn't going anywhere soon. Set on the desert world of Arrakis, we experience a brutal and mysterious ecosystem of secretive tribes and gargantuan sand worms. Frank Herbert expanded the book into a series, which was continued (with varying success) by his son after his passing. I read Dune a while ago, when I may have been a little too young for it. I had to reread the first 50 pages after realising I had no idea what was happening. It's a science fiction legend that I'm sure is loved for a reason, and one day I hope to appreciate it the same way masses of other fans do."],

            "Review": ["Reading The Sirens of Titan had a profound impact on me, and really made me realise what was possible in the genre. \r Kurt Vonnegut writes in a way unparalleled by any other author I've encountered. His work is at once deep and profound, yet so casual and throw away it all feels like a big joke. And to Vonnegut, it is. Everything we hold dear is unimportant, pointless, and for the most part, unchangeable (so why worry?). \r While this sounds pretty harsh, there is some solace to be found in this conclusion. By highlighting the foolishness of humanity, and pairing it with an unforgiving universe with a sense of humour, there's a kind of solace in knowing that we can't mess up too badly for it to matter. (If you read the book, you know it's not as bad as a certain other character who makes a certain other mistake)! The Sirens of Titan is a book I think perfectly captures Vonnegut's main ideas. His most popular work, Slaughterhouse 5, is a brilliant work of fiction, but doesn't go as wild as this novel. All of the bizarre seemingly unrelated plot threads not only tie up to a clean resolution, but also end up so tightly intertwined it's a marvel to even begin to understand it. Especially with the time jumping, what at first seems like nonsensical fun reveals itself to be a masterpiece with a much deeper meaning."],

            "Review": ["Flowers for Algernon now and always will be one of my all time favourite books, regardless of genre. it still surprises me how a book over 60 years old still comes across with so much heart that still affects the reader in the modern day. At the time of my first reading I had never read anything so original. The book is written from Charlie's perspective, as his own diary. Because we first meet Charlie as a mentally disabled bakery cleaner, the butt of everyones affectionate but cutting jokes, his diary entries are littered with spelling mistakes and a childlike perspective of the world. As the plot progresses and Charlie gains increased intelligence, we see the same world in his new perspective, and get a real insight into his mind as he navigates his strange new world. An aspect of this I love is the exploration of how intelligence affects his relations with friends, colleagues and lovers. Seeing the contrast between a handicapped Charlie pining to be smarter and a vastly educated Charlie struggling to come to terms with the world makes it almost feel like two separate characters completely. Keyes writes both wildly different perspectives perfectly, bringing what could feel like two separate novellas in the hands of a lesser author into a brilliant and desperate narrative. Flowers for Algernon is a book I hope to always come back to, and I don't think I'll ever be unaffected by the brilliant but painful ending."],

I remember at the time actually enjoying it, until I saw a review of it which pretty quickly made me see it a different way. The review described the book as Frankenstein, if Frankenstein's creation was not a revived corpse amalgamation but instead a dog - and that's actually pretty accurate. The book is sentimental, and at times very sweet. We struggle alongside Sirius as he adjusts to life in a human world trapped in a dogs body which causes him to struggle to read books or play the piano. All the while, he struggles watching his very human sister blossom and live her life as a human woman. In its favour, the book does make us think about what makes life worth living and highlights the struggle to survive for beings who don't fit into the standard mold. Did I enjoy reading the book? Yes, absolutely. Would I recommend it? I can't. Though vintage science fiction, in hindsight the plot seems more like it would suit a short story better."],

Also the oldest in this list, The War of the Worlds suffers in modern day for being generic due to the fact it is pretty much the basis of the genre, at least as far as evil invading aliens. H. G. Wells is also a household name, with notable works also including The Invisible Man and The Time Machine. I grew up listening to the CD of the radio musical performance, and as a kid I loved and was terrified by the film starring Tom Cruise. With all of this said, I really struggled with this book. It's age shows on every page (unsurprising at over 120 years old, I know) and the writing is slow and for the most part, impossibly given the subject material, pretty dull. The novel takes place in and around London, and the sheer number of references to real life locations is totally lost on someone who doesn't have much information on London past the Monopoly board. For its age the ideas in this book are extraordinary and its influence is undeniable. It seems to have a similar problem to a lot of Lovecraft's stories. Great and original ideas, but stuck in its outdated language and ancient attitudes to way of life in contrast to the present day. It just isn't a fun read for me."],

We follow the character of Helward Mann, a citizen of the moving city. We see him grow from a young man into full adult and follow his journey in different roles in the city. This exposure gives us insight into the painful logisitics of their conundrum and feel the same fear of falling behind the optimum - the threat of being crushed by the gravitational field. This book gets weird, in a brilliant and scientific way. There is the threat of so many mysteries not being satisfyingly resolved. For example, what is the optimum, why the gravity fields, why is the city called \"Earth\" and why is the number of female births declining? Yet, even with all of these questions, Christopher Priest comes through with a blunt but satisfying conclusion. I couldn't have guessed at the twist the book presented at the end, a shift of perspective so memorable I value this book so highly. There is of course much more to this book tha its brilliant ending, with exploration into dynamics of civilization, gender roles, and governmental control. I don't want to give anything away, but I strongly encourage anyone else to read this novel."],

This book isn't fully alien, however, we do see the narrative from Charles Lackland as well as Mesklinite Barlennan. It's refreshing to read a science fiction story of cooperation rather than the all so common aggresion between alien species.

They can only conceive when the temperature is between six and ninety-three, but to actually give birth, they have to be above ninety-three.”",

Eager to establish first contact with the planet's humanlike inhabitants, he finds himself increasingly entangled in their primitive way of life.

When he lands on Earth—in Kentucky, disguised as a human—it's with the intention of saving his own people from extinction. Newton patents some very advanced Anthean technology, which he uses to amass a fortune. He begins to build a spaceship to help the last 300 Antheans migrate to Earth. Meanwhile, Nathan Bryce, a chemistry professor in Iowa, is intrigued by some of the new products Newton's company brings to the market and already suspects Newton of being an alien. As Bryce and the FBI close in, Newton finds his own clarity and sense of purpose diminishing.",

            "Quote": "A picnic. Picture a forest, a country road, a meadow. Cars drive off the country road into the meadow, a group of young people get out carrying bottles, baskets of food, transistor radios, and cameras. They light fires, pitch tents, turn on the music. In the morning they leave. The animals, birds, and insects that watched in horror through the long night creep out from their hiding places. And what do they see? Old spark plugs and old filters strewn around... Rags, burnt-out bulbs, and a monkey wrench left behind... And of course, the usual mess—apple cores, candy wrappers, charred remains of the campfire, cans, bottles, somebody's handkerchief, somebody's penknife, torn newspapers, coins, faded flowers picked in another meadow.",
