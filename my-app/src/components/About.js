        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Thanks so much for checking out my web page! I made this using React, you can find the repo for this page <a href="https://github.com/Jack-Burge55/personal-website" target="_blank" className='textLink'>here</a>. </p>
        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>My name's Jack, and I'm currently a software developer based close to Manchester, UK. I primarily work on front end but am interested in full stack work in the future. I have lots of interests, as you can tell from this page board games and reading are two big ones. I also love movies, walks with my labrador and spending time with friends. I have passively learnt Spanish over the last 4 years and would love to live and work abroad in a sunny city somewhere. You can also email me at jack.burgess412@gmail.com if you'd like, I'd love to hear from you :). Here's a photo of me and my dog below.</p>
